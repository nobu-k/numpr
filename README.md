# Number Place in Rust

Number place solvers and problem generators in Rust.
This is my experimental project to learn Rust and its ecosystem.

## TODOs

* Add rustdoc
* Try perf
* Improve Error types

## Number place TODOs

* Add a solver using masks to fill grids having fewer candidates
* Add an evaluator to compute the difficulty of a puzzle
* Add a generator that creates a puzzle having a specific difficulty defined by the evaluator
* Add a generator to create hardest possible puzzles
